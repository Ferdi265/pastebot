# Pastebot
This is a telegram bot forked from a friend of mine, as he wasn't interested in developing it anymore.
It supports every way files can be send on telegram! (If not, please open an issue and I will try to add support for it!)
Just send any type of file to the bot or use the /text command to upload stuff to your webserver! The bot will then reply with a url to your file. The filename will be random.

# Installation

## Python
 - **Python 3** (Tested with **3.8.10**)
 - Venv
     - ```bash
        python -m venv pastebot
        source pastebot/bin/activate
        pip install python-telegram-bot
        ```

---

## Telegram Side
1. Go to **BotFather** and create a new bot.
2. Put the token you get into *"TMPBOT_TELEGRAM_TOKEN"* in [.env](.env#L1)
3. Put your telegram-username ***with the @*** into *"TMPBOT_TELEGRAM_WHITELIST"* in [.env](.env#L2)

## Locally hosted bot server
Please take a look at [***this***](https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api) repository!

---
## .env
```bash
export TMPBOT_TELEGRAM_TOKEN="TELEGRAM_TOKEN" # Your telegram token
export TMPBOT_TELEGRAM_WHITELIST="USERNAME_WHITELIST" # Separated by ":", example: "username1:username2:username3"; WITHOUT @-symbol!
export TMPBOT_PASTE_URL="https://tmp.example.com" # URL where you host the files. This is where you can access the uploaded content.
export TMPBOT_PASTE_DIR="tmp" # Relative path to folder where content will be saved. Example: if value is "tmp", files will be located in a folder called 'tmp' in the same directory as the bot.py file
export TMPBOT_BOT_NAME="MY_BOT" # This has not to be the same as the name specified by BotFather!
# export TMPBOT_DEL_ALL="" # Password used with /delete command to delete all hosted files (Usage: /delete <PASSWORD>). Will not delete index.php file in case you have a file listing script in there.
# export TMPBOT_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8081/bot" # Only specify if using local bot server.
# export TMPBOT_TIMEOUT="120" # For bigger files, this timeout must be specified because of the communication speed between telegram and the bot-server in case of using a locally hosted server because of network timeout issues.
export TMPBOT_GENERATE_LENGTH="20" # How long the random filename should be
export TMPBOT_GENERATE_TRIES="20" # How often the script should try to generate a random filename until it throws a exception
```

## Service File
I recommend creating a user for the bot.
```
[Unit]
Description=Pastebot
; Requires=pastebot-telegram-server.service # Uncomment if you use self hosted telegram-bot-server (Change the service name accordingly)

[Service]
User=pastebot # Change to the user you set up for the bot
Group=pastebot # Same as 'User'
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/cloned-folder
ExecStart=/path/to/cloned-folder/start.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
---

## NGINX config
This config will have some rules only to execute the index.php in the root path, so that you can use a index.php to for example list all your files. I recommend [file-directory-list by halgatewood](https://github.com/halgatewood/file-directory-list/). Remember to change the php-fpm to the installed version number!
```nginx
server {
    server_name "tmp.example.com";
    root /path/to/pastebot/tmp-folder;

    location / {
		try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ @extensionless-php @not-found;
		index index.php;
	}

    location ~ ^/index.php$ {
		include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;

		# With php-fpm (or other unix sockets):
		fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.x-fpm.sock; # change to your php socket
		# With php-cgi (or other tcp sockets):
		#	fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
	}

    location ~ \.php$ {
        types { } default_type "text/plain; charset=utf-8";
    }

    location @not-found {
        return 302 /;
    }

    location @extensionless-php {
        rewrite ^(.*)$ $1.php last;
    }

    server_tokens off;
}
```

# Usage / Commands
Here you can find the command usage of the bot.

- **/help** - Displays the help for the bot.

    voluptua. At vero eos et accusam et
    ```
- **/debug** - Only works for the first user defined in *'TMPBOT_TELEGRAM_WHITELIST'*. Prints all arrays containing stuff like infos for the long-text-routines.
